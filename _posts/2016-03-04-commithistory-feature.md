Sometimes, the files you need right now the most are stored somewhere else. That's why Git2Go perfectly integrates with available Document Providers.
You're thereby also able to edit any file you like in your favorite editor like Texttastic or Byword and even import your most recent photo or file for committing it to your favorite repository.
