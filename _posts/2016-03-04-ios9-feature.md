Git2Go is built to take advantage of Apple's latest innovations. That's why it fully supports brand new iOS 9 features like Spotlight search for cloned repositories or Slide Over and Split View.
If you're also rocking a shiny new iPhone 6S or 6S Plus, you can easily preview files from your repositories using 3D Touch aka Peek and Pop.
