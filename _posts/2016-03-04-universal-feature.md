We share Apple's vision of iOS devices being the future of computing. That's why Git2Go is a fully compatible Universal App right out of the gate and is meant to work perfectly on all iOS screen sizes.<br>This way, you'll easily be able to procastinate some of the more heavy mobile Git lifting to the slightly larger screen and keyboard.
So you can finally order the shiny new iPad Pro and experience a completely new Git productivity on iOS.
