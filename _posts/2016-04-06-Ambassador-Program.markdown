We are excited to announce the Git2Go Ambassador program today.

## What is it?

It is important to us to connect to our users, to know their needs and find out how we can make Git2Go an even better application. Maybe even with features we just hear between the lines. We also want to pitch new features to them and see if they like what we are currently working on. Last but not least we need real users to showcase how Git2Go influences their live so more people can enjoy it in their work environment.

## Who are we looking for?

We are looking for people who use the app extensively, like to share their thoughts and see the future of iOS as brightly as we do. Please note that this is not bound to developers only. Managers use Git2Go to keep on top of changes within their team or application they manage, artists use Git2Go to save their work and bloggers use it to update their website.

We are looking for a diverse group to represent our user base and anyone is welcome to apply.

## What are the benefits?

1. You get full beta access for the lifetime of the program
2. Get the possibility to engage with us on a regular basis, share your thoughts about  cool features or your latest workflow
3. We will share our ideas of the app with you
4. You will get two free enterprise licenses for your friends and coworkers
5. You get mentioned in the ambassador section on our website

We hope you like the idea as much as we do and we would love you to apply for it:
