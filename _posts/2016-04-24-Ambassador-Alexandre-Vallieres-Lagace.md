My goal as a Blogger for [hipsterpixel.co](https://hipsterpixel.co) was to develop a publishing workflow, that allows me to write wherever I am, whenever I want. Commuting to my day job means I have time in public transport which I can use for my blog. When I made the switch from Ghost to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) in 2015 mobile publishing was on top of my list. Researching on how to clone git repositories and alter files on iOS, I noticed Git2Go.

Articles are written using [1Writer](http://1writerapp.com/) and saved in git. Git2Go makes publishing on my iPhone easy for me. It integrates perfectly in my existing workflow using features such as 1Writer actions and the Document Provider extension. I use Bitbucket with a webhook configured to be triggered when I push a new commit. That allows me to automatically build the site from source and upload the generated files to my server.
