I have my blog saved on Github and use Git2Go to pull it, make changes and then commit back the changes. Although I haven't upgraded yet, I'm starting to think it would be interesting to do so given our company has a Gitlab CE and I like to version control my personal notes too (not on Github due to privacy concerns).
