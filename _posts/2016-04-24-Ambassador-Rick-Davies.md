I work on Github every day and have developed a small internal app that publishes merged pull requests directly to Shopify. It allows me to develop for Shopify on iOS using Git2Go. This has been my dream forever. Reviewing code, merging and publishing from anywhere.

Until I discovered Git2Go I struggled with mobile editors. It is easy to integrate Textastic via the document provider. This lets me make changes effortlessly using an editor which supports over 80 languages. Split view on iPad lets this integration shine, as I can make commits without leaving the editor.
