I wish I had known about git and its opportunities while writing the final thesis for my university studies.

When I wrote my final thesis a few years ago I had heard about git but only in the context of saving different versions of code. So I never even considered it helpful in the matter of writing a scientific paper. Looking back I know now that my life could have been so much easier in many ways.

1. Backups
	I saved my backups on different USB sticks and external hard drives. Since my thesis included many diagrams and images each copy needed quite some space. So I filled up directories and external storage media with copies.
	Also it was kind of hard to keep track which external hard drive actually contained what version. Trying to clean up the whole mess at some point I managed to delete my latest version. Don’t ask me how that happened, it sure was not intended. Luckily it was still stored in iCloud, but you can imagine how close I was to a heart attack at that point.

	Git providers have remote servers so your documents will always be stored in their cloud and you don’t need to worry about ten different hard drives to keep your paper save. Github being one provider even has a free plan for students.

2. Versions and Changes
	In order to document the evolution of the document I kept saving new versions marked with the date of the latest changes, but to be honest I hardly went back to actually look at the changes from one version to another. It’s just too much hassle going back forth between two huge documents.

	Git shows you side by side the changes you have made, what has been added, what has been changed and what has been deleted. So you are less tempted to change the same sentence back and forth. 

3. Reworking
	I am sure everybody who ever has written a complex paper, (Mine ended up having about 120 pages all together), knows how hard it is to keep track on the parts that you may have checked and double checked already, and whenever you go back you will find pieces that you want to change, since for whatever reason they don’t feel quite right to you anymore. 

	Since you have an overview of the changes you have made. Reworking drafts is also easier since you know what you have done already and therefor where to continue. This saves a lot of your time.

In order to make use of them you just need to use a git compatible editor.
I wrote my thesis in Pages for Mac and the option of showing diffs doesn’t work with Pages. I suspect it wouldn’t work with Word documents either, but git does work with LaTex, which is quite common to use for writing scientific papers.
You can basically use any markdown editor and it will support the full set of git features. 
I have come to like Ulysses a lot for its clean design, the document analytics and the options to export it in many different document types. I mainly use it for writing blog articles but it handles especially large documents very well.

As you see, git in combination with a text editor has the ability to ease many common troubles when writing complex papers.
