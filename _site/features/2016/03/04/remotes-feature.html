<p>Take all your Git accounts with you by connecting them in Git2Go. Logging in is super smooth and you’re immediately able to access all your repositories.</p>

<p>GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, Bitbucket, GitLab and self-hosted GitLab EE + CE are fully supported!</p>

<p>While everybody can directly start cloning their public repositories, private ones require the one time ‘Git2Go Private’ In App-Purchase (which will make our indie hearts jump). If you want to go full enterprise as well, we have a bundled ‘Git2Go Unlimited’ IAP ready to go for you.</p>
